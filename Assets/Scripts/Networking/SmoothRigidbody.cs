/// <summary>
/// A script example that can be used for game objects with a rigidbody is game when the server 
/// is authoritative and physics is done on the server.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// When using this example script, it should be added as a component to the game object that a player 
/// controls or the server controls.
///
/// Add this script to the creator prefab, the owner prefab and the proxy prefab for this game object.
/// The game object must have a rigidbody, not a character controller component.
/// The observed property of the uLinkNetworkView for the game object should be set to this component.
///
/// The client side prefabs (the proxy prefab and the owner prefab) should set the properties in the 
/// rigidbody component like this: 
/// Drag = 0
/// Use Gravity = false (should be true on the server, the creator prefab, if you are using gravity in the game)
/// Is Kinematic = false (must be set in proxy and owner - because this script does set rigidbody.velocity directly to move the object in the client)
/// Interpolate = Interpolate (required) - Default value is None, so make sure you do change this value. 
///
/// How it works: The basic idea for this script is that the creator object moves in the server by some logic 
/// outside of this script. The movement could be controlled by AI logic or path finding logic or RPCs from some client adding 
/// forces to the creater object. The server does all the collision detection (using the physics engine in Unity) and then the server 
/// sends state sync messages to all proxies (and the owner) including position and rotation.
/// 
/// The client side prefabs (the proxy prefab and the owner prefab) should NOT have a collider component.
/// 
/// The client shows a smooth movement for proxies and the owner, it is not exaclty like the server simulation,
/// but a good aproximation, and that is all it can be due to latency and packet loss over the network. 
/// The smoothing logic in the clients compares the object's current position (in the client) and the position in the 
/// LAST arriving state sync message. This way the client side object will always try to move in the direction of the most
/// "fresh" position informtion that has arrived to the client. 
///
/// A more complete example of usage: The client controlling this objects sends mouse and keyboard input to the server
/// using RPCs. The creator object in the server recieves this. The create object will move due to the client input and other
/// forces like objects colliding. The resulting position and rotation is send from the server to all clients using state sync.
/// This script does state sync sending sending. The clients recievs the state sync (done by this script) and calcualted a smooth 
/// new velocity for the client side object and applices this velocity to the rigidbody.
/// 
/// </remarks>
